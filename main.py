    Problem:
    Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.

    -You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
    -The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
    -You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.
        -For these cities, you have the city population.

    Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?
